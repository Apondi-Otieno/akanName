            <h4>A brief history of Akan Names</h4>
            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and
                the<br>
                order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character
                of<br>
                the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status,
                or<br>
                an ancestor's middle name.
                <br>
                This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the
                18th–19th<br>
                centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to
                as<br>
                Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee
                or<br>
                Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.<br>

                Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian
                name.<br>
                Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United
                Nations<br>
                Secretary-General Kofi Annan.<br>

                In the official orthography of the Twi language, the Ashanti versions of these names as spoken in Kumasi
                are<br>
                as follows. The diacritics on á a̍ à represent high, mid, and low tone (tone does not need to be marked
                on<br>
                every vowel), while the diacritic on a̩ is used for vowel harmony and can be ignored. (Diacritics
                are<br>
                frequently dropped in any case.) Variants of the names are used in other languages, or may represent<br>
                different transliteration schemes. The variants mostly consist of different affixes (in Ashanti, kwa- or
                ko-<br>
                for men and a- plus -a or -wa for women). For example, among the Fante, the prefixes are kwe-, kwa or ko
                for<br>
                men and e-, arespectively. Akan d̩wo or jo(Fante) is pronounced something like English Joe, but there
                do<br>
                appear to be two sets of names for those born on Monday.</p>
