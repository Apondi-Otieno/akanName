            <h4>A brief history of Akan Names</h4>
            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and
                the<br>
                order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character
                of<br>
                the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status,
                or<br>
                an ancestor's middle name.
                <br>
                This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the
                18thâ€“19th<br>
                centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to
                as<br>
                Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee
                or<br>
                Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.<br>
